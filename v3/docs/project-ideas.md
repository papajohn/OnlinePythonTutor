# Project Ideas

This document provides an overview of some project ideas for extending
Online Python Tutor (thereafter abbreviated as OPT). View it online at:

https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/project-ideas.md

These projects are listed roughly in order of difficulty.

Email philip@pgbovine.net if you're interested in working on anything here, or if you have other
project ideas.


## Enable beautiful printouts of OPT visualizations (easy)

A lot of instructors want to print out their OPT visualizations to make handouts or lecture notes
for students.
However, the default CSS is optimized for on-screen viewing and not for printing,
so when you try to print the diagrams, they look ugly and unreadable.

The project involves creating a custom CSS optimized for printing, especially on black-and-white printers.
Here is an example how-to guide to get started creating a CSS print style sheet ...

## Implement responsive web UI design for OPT frontend (easy/medium)

This is a good project for someone interested in visual and web design.

Implement the principles of [responsive web design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design)
so that OPT visualizations (and the surrounding user interface) look good on displays of many different sizes
ranging from smartphones to tablets to laptops to giant desktop monitors.


## Optimize display of object-oriented programs (medium)

This is a good project for an object-oriented programming enthusiast.

Right now OPT naively visualizes all the steps that the Python interpreter takes when executing an
object-oriented program, which leads to all sorts of extraneous variables, frames, and pointers
lying around.

This project involves cleaning up the execution trace so that object-oriented programs look
sensible when visualized.


## Add better Unicode support (medium)

This project is a great fit for someone familiar with coding in non-English languages.

Right now, OPT has poor-to-nonexistent Unicode support, so adding it is important for making it friendlier to
non-English audiences.

Here is one bug report that inspired this project idea:

"""
I’m having some fun with your nifty Python visualiser.
While trying too see what happens in Unicode strings are processed,
I encountered some odd little quirks such as a unicode character
being replace with a string representation of a Unicode code point
number in denary.


<a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=s+%3D+unicode(0x2015)%0Aa+%3D+'Myer'+%2B+s+%2B+'Briggs'%0Ax+%3D+a.index(s)%0Al+%3D+a%5B%3Ax%5D%0Ar+%3D+a%5Bx+%2B+len(s)%3A%5D%0Aprint+l%0Aprint+r%0Aprint+'%22'+%2B+a+%2B+'%22+is+'+%2B+str(len(a))+%2B+'+characters+long.'%0Afor+i,+z+in+unumerate(a)%3A%0A++print+'a%5B'+%2B+str(i)+%2B+'%5D+%3D+'+%2B+str(z)&mode=display&cumulative=false&py=2&curInstr=8">click to visualize code snippet</a>

Changing the first line to

```python
s = u'\u2015'
```

Causes an “unknown error” to be reported, as does the insertion of unicode characters like “—” (em dash) in string literals.

The following code causes the interpreter to hang.
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
s = u'—'
```
"""

(Note that Unicode support in Python 2 and 3 involve different subtleties.)


## Create an OPT backend for a different programming language (hard)

This project is great for someone who likes to hack on language implementations and runtimes.

The OPT frontend can visualize programs written in any mainstream language, not just Python.
This project involves creating a backend for another language (e.g., Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Scheme).
All the backend needs to do is to generate an execution trace in the following format ...

https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/opt-trace-format.md

... and the frontend should be able to visualize it!

My
[master's thesis](http://pgbovine.net/projects/pubs/guo-mixedlevel-mengthesis.pdf) from 2006
describes one possible technique for building a C-language backend based upon the [Valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org)
tool. More importantly, it describes the difficulties involved in creating a robust execution
trace generator for C and C++. It should be much easier to build a backend for a memory- and type-safe language, though :)


## Migrate OPT backend to Skulpt (very hard but super cool!)

This project is appropriate for someone with advanced knowledge of hacking a Python interpreter
who is willing to make a substantive time commitment.

Right now the OPT backend runs Python code on the server, but it would be super-cool to create a "backend"
that runs entirely in the browser. Modifying Skulpt -- http://www.skulpt.org/ -- is the leading contender here,
since I am in touch with its main developers.

Main Advantages:
  - Enables fine-grained tracing of expression and sub-expression evaluation, which has clear pedagogical benefits; right now OPT can only single-step over one line at a time since it relies on the Python bdb debugger.
  - Enables an interactive REPL that incrementally takes in user inputs rather than just executing batch programs; this can lead to better interactivity and responsiveness.
  - Supports on-demand evaluation and in-memory storage of (relatively) large data structures such as a 100,000-element dictionary for a spell checker program; right now OPT must send that giant dictionary in a trace (encoded in an inefficient format).
  - Works in "offline mode" for students in regions without reliable Internet access


Tips & Tricks:
  - From Brad Miller: http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/03/adding-module-to-skulpt.html and http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/python-in-your-browser-in-javascript.html
  - From Scott Graham, when I asked him whether Skulpt implements Python 2 or 3: “Mostly 2-ish. Some object hierarchy things take after 3's simplified semantics.”
