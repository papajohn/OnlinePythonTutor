  hi python fans (and non-fans) ...

  this is what i've been hacking on for the past few days instead of
  doing my research ;)  i'm planning to use it as a platform for
  creating interactive online programming tutorials as part of a
  volunteer project ...

  http://python.pgrind.com/

  it'd be great to get your feedback on what i have so far.  i'd love
  to hear suggestions or complaints.  thanks in advance!

  please don't share this link yet, mostly because my app is still
  buggy and insecure (i definitely don't want random peoples from the
  internet trying to hack it right now!)

  Dear subset of people who cared about my prior email from almost 2
  years ago ...

  I've recently kicked it up a notch with a "2.0" version and am about
  to do a public release soon.  I'd really appreciate any feedback,
  criticism, and especially bug reports on Internet Explorer ;)

  http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/opt-prerelease/

  Please don't share the link yet since it will be dead soon when I
  move this app to its permanent home.  I just want to get some early
  feedback to eliminate the obviously embarrassing bugs before launch.

  THANKS!
